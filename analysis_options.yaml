# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

# Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
# section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
# or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
# `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
# producing the lint.

# Additional information about this file can be found at
